# CMPN403-Compiler

Languages and Compilers Project - third year CUFE students.

A compiler for a mini-language inspired by C.  
Major differences include:

- No pointers.
- No casts.
- No structs or unions.
- A 'try-catch-finally' block.

Currently in phase 1, this project consists of two phases:

- Lexer and parser rules.
- TODO
