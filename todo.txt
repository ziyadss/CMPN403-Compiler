refactoring, low priority:
3 operation functions -> to 1 or 2






requirements:
generate ASM for
comparison in non-cond expressions

AST and ASM for
try-catch & stacktrace - current scope - lost in AST->ASM? found in refactored AST nodes?

symbol table
	check if var exists / right access
	return errors decently
	further semantic checks?

enums

type conversion quadruples
	on generation, if valid cast exists output cast quadruple, else return semantic error of invalid operands
