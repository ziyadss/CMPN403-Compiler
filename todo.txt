3 operation functions -> to 1 or 2

generate ASM for
comparison in non-cond expressions

generate AST for - then ASM
switch - bunch of ifs, handling a label to break to
try-catch & stacktrace - current scope - lost in AST->ASM? found in refactored AST nodes?
break/continue jumps to labels, one before one after

symbol table
	check if var exists / right access
	return errors decently
	further semantic checks?

gui

enums

type conversion quadruples
	on generation, if valid cast exists output cast quadruple, else return semantic error of invalid operands
