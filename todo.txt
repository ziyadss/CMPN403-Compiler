refactoring, low priority:
3 operation functions -> to 1 or 2




requirements, ordered by priority:
AST and ASM for
try-catch & stacktrace - current scope - lost in AST->ASM? found in refactored AST nodes?

enums

symbol table
	check if var exists / right access
	return errors decently
	further semantic checks?

type conversion quadruples
	on generation, if valid cast exists output cast quadruple, else return semantic error of invalid operands

ASM for
comparison in non-cond expressions
